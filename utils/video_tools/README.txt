External Dependencies:
Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox (http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/)

Modified versions of Dollar's code used for annotating/viewing the 
Caltech Pedestrians Dataset (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/). 

These tools handle all the video file formats that MATLAB's VideoReader supports.

The Video Bounding Box (vbb) format has also been updated to allow for individuals seen at different 
points in time in a video to have the same id number.
